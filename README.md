# RNA_seq_workflow

This collection of scripts and functions describes an RNA-Seq pipeline from fastq files through analysis.

Intended final product:  
1. Example script for using Salmon to quantify fastq files  
2. Script to import and set up data in preparation for analysis  
3. Script for exploring data and quality control  
4. Differential gene expression analysis using DESeq2
5. Differential transcript usage analysis using DRIMSeq  
6. Gene ontology analysis using topGO  
7. Example script for comparing multiple datasets
